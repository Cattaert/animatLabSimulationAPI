# animatLabSimulationAPI
Python library designed to manage large-scale AnimatLab simulation and optimization projects

Implementation of this script requires the packages listed below. Most of these packages are now standard with a basic scientific installation of Python such as Anaconda <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index> or Spyder <https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/>. If you choose to use an installation from a scientific Python bundle, keep in mind that there will NUMEROUS packages that will also be installed, but are not used by this AnimatLab API library. If you prefer to minimize the memory footprint of your Python installation, you can install each package individually. Depending on your operating system, instructions may vary, so you can Google "python install [package name]", where [package name] is replaced with the name of the package below.
